    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>The average person surveyed loses nine items daily. Over a course of a lifetime that's nearly 3,300 items per year and thousands of dollars spent by the average person to replace those items, especially if those are expensive electronics. The emotional impact of losing an item cannot be ignored. Sadness, anger, and irritation can be felt but letâ€™s shed light on the joy and feeling of relief of finding an item you once thought was gone forever.</p>          
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>Our product was designed to assist in reuniting lost items with their owner. We have observed that users often have a difficult time connecting with their neighborhood around them which is causing items to never be returned to their owners. As a result our users are not finding items they have lost and/or not returning items they have found.</p>          
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>We aim to design an app that helps individuals living in the same neighborhood to connect and share information about lost and found items and belongings. This service will help ensure that all lost items are returned to their rightful owners in a timely and efficient manner.</p>          
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>Methodology: 
        Preliminary user interviews were conducted to obtain qualitative data from individuals. A survey created before the interviews will be sent to participants after the interviews are conducted. Data will be analyzed from the interviews and the survey, to develop a user persona.</p>
        
        <p>Participants: 
        The ideal participants for this research will comprise of individuals who live in a community. They find themselves losing belongings, and/or finding items that belong to others. They are helpful and find joy in keeping their community friendly.</p>

    <p class="lead">For the Ideation phase, our team each came up with of 4 sketches and together voted on the best sketch design to move forward with wireframing.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>During the process, we created 2 different storyboards for this function. It also made the most sense because of the flexibility of the app to be both locally and city wide for reporting and finding lost items.</p>
